\chapter{The ALICE experiment}
ALICE (\textit{A Large Ion Collider Experiment}) is one of the four major experiments at the \textit{Large Ion Collider}, at CERN, in Geneva. It was expressly designed to study heavy ion collisions, continuing the tradition of experiments such as STAR and PHENIX at RHIC, but also experiments held at SPS and AGS before. The aim of the experiment is the study of the QGP, using Pb-Pb collisions. However, ALICE has also a program with data from p-p and p-Pb collisions, needed to discern final state effects from initial states effects.\\
In this chapter a description of the experimental set up will be given, focusing on the \textit{Inner Tracking System}, after a brief introduction about the LHC.

The LHC is the world's largest and most powerful accelerator. It consists of a 27 km ring of superconducting magnets with a number of accelerating structures to boost the energy of the particles up to their collision energy and keep them stable, compensating the energy loss. The LHC is designed to deliver p-p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, with a rate of 40 MHz, and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV, with a rate of 8 kHz. However, in the first run the LHC did not work at the highest energy, collecting mainly data for p-p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. In the second run, instead, the LHC is working at the design energies.\\
In Figure \ref{fig:LHC} a schematic view of the accelerator complex of CERN is shown. Protons and lead ions pass through different processes before reaching the LHC. Starting from protons, they are extracted from an hydrogen tank and injected in the linear accelerator LINAC2, where they reach an energy of 50 MeV. Then, they are accelerated to 1.4 GeV in the \textit{Proton Synchrotron Booster} (PSB) and injected in the \textit{Proton Synchrotron}, where they reach an energy of 25 GeV. Then, in the \textit{Super Proton Synchrotron} (SPS) they reach 450 GeV and are finally injected in the LHC. For lead ions the process is different, in particular in the initial steps. First of all, lead (Pb$^{208}$) ions are extracted from a purified sample of lead brought to high temperatures ($\sim$ 500 GeV) thanks to microwaves and the partially ionized by a stream of electrons, creating ions with different charges, among which only Pb$^{29+}$ are selected. After being accelerated in LINAC3 at 4.2 MeV per nucleon, more electrons are stripped by passing through a carbon foil. Only Pb$^{54+}$ are kept end then accelerated in the \textit{Low Energy Ion Ring} (LEIR) at 5.9 MeV. Then the ions are transferred to the PS, where they reach the energy of 5.9 GeV per nucleon end then pass through a copper foil, being fully stripped. The beam of Pb$^{82+}$ is then injected in the SPS (177 GeV per nucleon) and finally in the LHC, where they reach their final energy.
\section{Design considerations for ALICE}
The multiplicity of produced particles is a very important characteristic in the heavy ion collision experiments. For these kind of studies, indeed, it is important to track and identify all the particles coming from the interaction region, in order to measure the quantities described in the previous chapter. As already mentioned, the ALICE experiment was designed when RHIC data were not available yet, and the estimated multiplicity for heavy ion collision at the energy of the LHC was 2000 - 6000 particles for rapidity units. Consequently, the ALICE experiment has been designed in order to bear a multiplicity of 8000 particles for rapidity units. When the RHIC measurements became available, they showed that the multiplicity range at LHC should have been 1500 - 4000 particles for rapidity unit. Therefore, the designed was optimized for $\frac{dN}{dy}\sim$ 4000. Working at such a high values of multiplicity is possible thanks to the low interaction rate for heavy ions collisions, which allows to use slow detectors, such as the time projection chamber and the silicon drift detectors, which are very suitable for the particle identification. Another important parameter that have been taken into account in the design of the experiment is the efficiency, defined as the ratio between detected particles and generated particles. ALICE has full efficiency in $\varphi$, i.e. it covers $2\pi$ radians in the azimuthal angle.\\
ALICE, moreover, has been designed to work on a wide $p_T$ range. In facts, thanks to the mild magnetic field (0.5 T), it is possible to track particles down to very low values of transverse momentum (tens of MeV). This feature is ideal for the study of particles with low momentum, but the combination of the chosen magnetic field with the presence of the long lever arm, which will be discussed later, allows precise momentum measurements even at high momentum ($p_T\lesssim$ 100 GeV/c).\\
Beside the reconstruction of the tracks of the particles, the particle identification (PID) is extremely important to reconstruct the particle spectra. At the ALICE experiment, the identification of particles with low transverse momentum (p < 4 GeV/c) is performed in the central barrel ($|\eta|$ < 0.9). For higher momenta, the particle identification can be done just in a restricted range of $\eta$ and $\varphi$ by specialized detectors and the measurement of the momentum has a reduced resolution, caused by the high bending radius of the particles.
\section{The ALICE experimental apparatus}
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{figures/ALICEapp.jpg}
  \caption{The ALICE experimental setup.}
  \label{fig:ALICEapp}
\end{figure}
%
The experimental setup of ALICE is shown in figure \ref{fig:ALICEapp}. It is composed of three main parts: the \textit{central barrel}, which covers the mid-rapidity region (|$\eta$|<0.9), the \textit{muon arm}, which covers the forward pseudorapidity range [-4; -2.5], and the \textit{forward detectors}.\\
All the detectors in the central barrel are immersed in the magnetic field of 5 T, generated by a ALICE solenoid magnet, used previously in the L3 experiment at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider. The detectors of the central barrel, starting from the beam line and going outwards, are: the \textit{Inner Tracking System} (ITS), the \textit{Time Projection Chamber} (TPC), the \textit{Transition Radiation Detector} (TRD), the \textit{Time Of Flight} (TOF), the \textit{High Momentum Particle IDentification} detector (HMPID), the \textit{PHOton Spectrometer} (PHOS), the \textit{ElectroMagnetic Calorimeter} (EMCal) and the \textit{ALICE COsmic Ray DEtector} (ACORDE).\\
In the muon arm there is the \textit{Muon Spectrometer}, a forward detector which lays outside the solenoid magnetic field.\\
Finally the forward detectors, which are located at a small angle with respect to the beam line, include the \textit{Zero Degree Caloremeter} (ZDC), the \textit{Photon Multiplicity Detector} (PMD), the \textit{Forward Multiplicity Detector}, the \textit{VZERO} detector (V0) and the \textit{TZERO} (T0).\\
All these detector will be described in the next sections, after the description of the coordinate system.
\subsection{The ALICE coordinate system}
The ALICE coordinate system is a right-handed Cartesian system with the origin $(x,y,z)=\vec{0}$ at the nominal beam interaction point. The axis are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{x axis:} it is perpendicular to the mean beam direction, aligned with the local horizontal and pointing the centre of the LHC;
 \item \textit{y axis:} it is perpendicular to the x axis and the beam direction, pointing upwards;
 \item \textit{z axis:} it is parallel to the beam direction, with the positive direction opposite to the Muon Spectrometer (ATLAS side).
\end{itemize}
ALICE has a cylindrical symmetry with respect to the z axis, therefore a polar system with z as polar axis is used.
\subsection*{The magnets}
The central barrel detectors are embedded in a magnet that is a room temperature solenoid magnet, which generates a moderate magnetic field of 0.5 T. This kind of magnetic field was has been chosen since it is enough intense to bend the trajectories of the particles but enough mild to allow the reconstruction of low momentum particles in the TPC. The lowest momentum that allows to reconstruct the track of a particle in the TPC is given by $p_{cut-off} = 0.3 BR \sim$ 0.2 GeV/c, where B is the magnetic field in Tesla, and R = 2.5 m is the external radius of the TPC. However, particles with lower momentum can be tracked using the ITS alone,\\
A dipole magnet is placed 7 m from the interaction vertex. It generates a field of 0.2 T, perpendicular to the beam direction that is used as bending field to measure the momentum of muons in the Muon Spectrometer.
\subsection*{The Inner Tracking System}
The ITS is the closest detector to the interaction point and is composed of six layers of silicon detectors of different technologies. Its main uses are the location of the primary vertex with a resolution better than 100 $\mu$m, the reconstruction of the secondary vertices of the decays of the heavy flavoured hadrons, D and B, and hyperons and the tracking and identification of low-$p_T$ particles. It also improves the momentum and angle resolution for tracks reconstructed by the TPC and allows the reconstruction of particles which traverse dead regions of the TPC. It also gives information about the particle energy loss in the four outer layers. A more detailed description of the ITS will be given later in a dedicated section.
\subsection*{The Time Projection Chamber}
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/tpc.png}
  \caption{The setup of the TPC.}
  \label{fig:TPC}
\end{figure}
%
The TPC is the main tracking detector of the central barrel. It is optimised to provide momentum measurements with good two-track separation, particle identification via \textit{dE/dx} and vertex determination together with the other detectors of the central barrels. The TPC cover the pseudorapidity range |$\eta$| < 9 for tracks with full radial length, i.e. with matches in ITS, TRD and TOF detectors. For particle with a reduced radial length it is possible to access an acceptance at |$\eta$| = 1.5, even if with a lower momentum resolution. The 2$\pi$ acceptance in the azimuthal angle is guaranteed by its cylindrical symmetry. The total active volume has an inner radius of $\sim$ 85 cm, an outer radius of $\sim$ 250 cm and a total length along the beam direction of $\sim$ 500 cm. The detector is made of a cylindrical field cage, with a central high-voltage electrode and two opposite axial potential dividers to create a highly uniform electric field. The cavity is filled with 90 m$^3$ of Ne/CO$_2$/N$_2$ (90/10/5).\\
When a charged particle passes through the TPC ionizes the gas creating electron-ion pairs. Thanks to the uniform electric field, the electrons drift towards the end-plates, where they are detected.
The gas mixture is therefore optimised for drift speed, low diffusion, low radiation length and hence low multiple scattering, small space charge effects and stability properties. In particular the N$_2$ improves the quenching of the electron multiplication, keeping the proportionality of the signal to the energy deposit of the charged particles and allowing a higher maximum gas gain. As far as the Ne/CO$_2$ is concerned, this mixture is a cold gas whose drift speed is strongly dependent on its temperature and therefore a high thermal stability is required ($\Delta$T $\leq$ 0.1 K).\\
In the end-plates the electrons are detected by multi-wire proportional chamber with cathode pad readout, providing the position in the transverse plane. The information about the z position is provided by the measure of the drift time, for witch it is necessary to use a trigger information from an external detector, like the V0. The position resolution is different  along the radial dimension because of the different track density: for the inner/outer radii is 1100/800 $\mu$m in the transverse plane and 1250/1100 $\mu$m along the beam axis.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{figures/TPC_Perf.png}
  \caption{\textit{dE/dx} of charged particles vs their momentum measured by the TPC in p-Pb collisions. The lines are a parametrization of the detector response based on the Bethe-Bloch formula.}
  \label{fig:TPC_Perf}
\end{figure}
%
The total charge collected collected at the end-plates is proportional to the energy loss of particles in the gas mixture and therefore the PID is possible via \textit{dE/dx}. In particular the \textit{dE/dx} resolution is 5\% for isolated tracks and 6.8\% in case of high occupancy. From \textit{dE/dx} measurements it is possible to identify different particles species in the momentum region where their \textit{dE/dx} are separated. This separation is better at low momentum (p $\lesssim$ 1 GeV/c), where the bands are more distant, but it is possible also at large values of the momentum (p $\gtrsim$ 4 GeV/c) thanks to the relativistic rise of \textit{dE/dx} in the TPC gas.\\
The TPC is a very good detector for tracking and PID, but the large drift time, of the order of 10$^-3$, is a great limit for the data acquisition rate.\\
\subsection*{The Transition Radiation Detector}
The TRD is used for identifying electrons with momentum above 1 GeV/c, for which the identification in the TPC by measuring the \textit{dE/dx} is no longer efficient. This detector is composed of 540 individual readout detector modules, with an inner radius of 2.9 m and an outer radius of 3.68 m. It works in the pseudorapidity range |$\eta$| < 0.84. The TRD is important, for example, for the separation of the electrons from the J/$\Psi$ decay from the background of Dalitz decays. Moreover combining the information about the impact parameter from the ITS and the identification from the TRD it is possible to study particles with an open charm or an open beauty quark decaying in their semi-leptonic channels. The TRD is composed of radiators in which photons are emitted by charged particles and of wire chambers filled wit Xe/CO$_2$. It is suitable for the identification of particles with a Lorentz $\gamma$ larger than 1000 and for this reason it can separate well electrons and pions whose momentum is in the range 1 GeV/c $\leq$ p $\leq$ 100 GeV/c.
\subsection*{The Time Of Flight}
The TOF detector consists of a large area array of Multi-gap Resistive Proportional Chambers (MRPC) in the central pseudorapidity range (|$\eta$| < 0.9). It is used for the PID in the intermediate momentum range, up to 2.5 GeV/c for pions and kaons, up to 5 GeV/c for protons. It has a cylindrical symmetry like the TPC, with an internal radius of 370 cm, an external one of 399 cm and a total length of 7.45. The thickness of the whole detector corresponds to 30\% of the radiation length. When a charged particle pass through the detector ionizes the gas creating an electron avalanche which is collected by the electrodes. The avalanche regime is possible thanks to the high electric fields inside the MWPC.\\

  \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{figures/TOF.png}
  \caption{$\beta$ vs momentum of charged particles measured by the TOF in p-Pb collisions.}
  \label{fig:TOF}
\end{figure}
%
The PID is based on the measure of the time of flight of a particle from the interaction point to the TOF detector. Using the track length measured with the ITS and the TPC and using as initial time the time of particle production, provided by the T0 detector, it is possible to measure the $\beta$ of the particle and, considering the momentum measure of the TPC, to identify the particle itself.\\
\subsection*{The High Momentum Particle Identification Detector}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{figures/HMPID.png}
  \caption{HMPID Cherenkov angle vs track momentum for p-Pb @ 5.02 TeV data, Continuous lines represent theoretical Cherenkov angle values vs track momentum.}
  \label{fig:HMPID}
\end{figure}
%
The HMPID is dedicated to the identification of hadrons at $p_T$ > 1 GeV/c, enhancing the PID capability of ALICE beyond the momentum interval attainable with ITS, TPC and TOF. In particular it has been optimized to extend the range for $\pi$/K and K/p discrimination respectively up to 3 GeV/c and 5 GeV/c. It is characterized by a small acceptance, 5\% of central barrel phase space, covering the pseudorapidity range |$\eta$|<0.6 and the azimuthal angle range 1.2\textdegree < $\varphi$ < 58.8\textdegree. The HMPID is based on proximity-focusing Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) and consists of seven modules of about 1.5 $\times$ 1.5 m$^2$ each, mounted at a distance of about 5 m from the beam line. When a charged particle passes through the radiator, filled with liquid perfluorohexane (C$_6$F$_{14}$), with a speed higher than the speed of light in the medium, Cherenkov photons are emitted. The Cherenkov photons are then detected by a photon counter made of CsI scintillators and a MWPC with pad cathode.
\subsection*{The Photon Spectrometer}
The main physics objective of the HMPID is the test of thermal and dynamical properties of the initial phase of the collision through the measurement of low $p_T$ direct photons and of the jet quenching, which can be obtained observing high-$p_T$ $\pi^0$ and $\gamma$-jet correlations. In order to distinguish the direct photons from those generated in $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ decay, good spatial and energetic resolution are needed. The detector consisted of five modules of lead-tungstate crystal (PbWO$_4$) and it is located at 4.6 m from the beam line. It has a low acceptance, covering the pseudorapidity range |$\eta$|<0.12 and the azimuthal angle range 220\textdegree < $\varphi$ < 320\textdegree.
\subsection*{The Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
The main goal of the EMCal is to enhance ALICE performances in the the study of the jet-quenching in Pb-Pb collisions. It extends the ALICE capabilities in detecting direct photons, jets and the electrons from heavy flavoured hadron decay. It provides complementary measurements to the PHOS, being positioned approximately in the opposite side, at a radius of about 4.5 m, adjacent to the magnet. It covers the pseudorapidity range |$\eta$|<0.7 and the azimuthal, with an azimuthal angle range $\Delta\varphi$ = 107\textdegree. The detector is a layered Pb-scintillator sampling calorimeter, alternating 1.44 mm of lead and 1.76 mm of polystyrene.
\subsection*{The ALICE Cosmic Ray Detector}
The ACORDE is an array of plastic scintillator counters placed on the upper surface of the L3 magnet and is used for the cosmic ray detection. It covers |$\varphi$| < 60 ◦ and |$\eta$| < 1.4 range and is positioned at a radius of 8.5 m. It plays a two-fold role in ALICE: the first is to provide a fast trigger signal for the commissionings, calibration and alignment procedures of the tracking detectors: the second is the detection, in combination with the TPC, the TRD and the TOF, of atmospheric muons to study high-energy cosmic rays in the in the energy region of the knee in the cosmic ray spectrum.
\subsection*{The Muon Spectrometer}
The Muon Spectrometer allows to reconstruct heavy quarkonia (charmonium and bottomonium states), as well as the $\phi$ meson, through their $\mu^+\mu^-$ decay channel at forward rapidity. The detector covers the pseudorapidity region -4.5 < $\eta$ < -2.5 and consists of different components. Before the detector itself there is a passive front absorber to screen the detector from hadrons and photons coming from the interaction point. The absorber is made of carbon and concrete, materials characterized by a low atomic number Z to balance screening necessities with the statistical error caused by the multiple scattering of the muons. The absorber is 4.13 m long, corresponding to  $\sim$ 60 X$_0$. After the absorber a high granularity tracking system made of ten detection planes, called \textit{tracking chambers} can be found. The tracking chambers consist of multi-wire proportional chambers with a pad cathode readout, in order to guarantee the high spatial resolution (100 $\mu$m) needed to separate the invariant mass spectra of the di-muons from quarkonia decay. For example, since the masses of the J/$\Psi$ and the $\Psi$' mesons are very close, a resolution of 70 MeV/c$^2$ around the value of 1 GeV/c$^2$ is needed. Similarly, a resolution of 100 MeV/c$^2$ around the value of 100 GeV/c$^2$ is needed to separate the $\Upsilon$ and the $\Upsilon$' mesons. Positive and negative muons are separated by the dipole magnet. In particular, the tracking chambers are arranged in five stations: two before, one inside and two after the dipole magnet. Then, the \textit{inner beam shield} protects the chambers from background originating from particles at small angles. It is made of tungsten, lead and stainless steel to minimize the background arising from primary particles emitted in the collision and from their showers produced in the beam pipe and in the shield itself. Finally, there is the trigger system, designed to select heavy quark resonance decays. The selection is made on the $p_T$ of the two individual muons. It consists of four planes of RPCs, arranged in two stations and positioned behind a passive muon filter, providing the transverse momentum of each muon.
\subsection*{The Zero Degree Calorimeter}
The ZDC consists of two pairs of hadronic calorimeters (one for protons and one for neutrons) located at 116 m on each side of the interaction point, along the beam line. The ZDC provides information about the centrality of Pb-Pb collisions measuring the energy of the spectator nucleons. at LHC indeed it is possible to parametrize the dependence of the energy collected in the ZDC on the number of spectators with the formula:
\begin{equation*}
 E_{ZDC} = \sqrt{s_{NN}} \times N_{spectators}
\end{equation*}
This formula is a god approximation in central events, while for peripheral events the nucleon fragmentation is important and consequently some fragments could not be detected, loosing the proportionality between $E_{ZDC}$ and $N_{spectators}$.\\
The calorimeters consists of tungsten as absorber material and quartz fibres as active material: when a particle passes through the passive material creates a shower which produces Cherenkov radiation, which is detected bay the active material. Moreover the ZDC is also position sensitive and therefore can provide an estimate of the reaction plane in nuclear collisions.
In addition, two small electromagnetic calorimeters (ZEM) are placed at about 7 m from the interaction point on each side f the beam pipe, opposite to the muon arm.
\subsection*{The Photon Multiplicity Detector}
The PMD measures the multiplicity and the spatial ($\eta$ - $varphi$) distribution of photons in the pseudorapidity region 2.3 $\leq \eta \leq$ 3.7. These measurements give estimations of the transverse electromagnetic energy and of the reaction plane. The PMD consists of a large array of gas (Ar/CO$_2$, 30/70) proportional counters in a honeycomb cellular structure and is located at 3.64m from the interaction point.
\subsection*{The Forward Multiplicity Detector}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{figures/FMD.jpg}
  \caption{FMD and T0 detectors.}
  \label{fig:FMD}
\end{figure}
%
The FMD provides information about the charged particle multiplicity in the pseudorapidity ranges -3.4 $\leq \eta \leq$ -1.7 and 1.7 $\leq \eta \leq$ 5.1. The measurement of charged particle multiplicity is important to study the particle flows and event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations. The FMD is composed of five rings of silicon strip detectors, two of them installed on the muon absorber side (FM3), the remaining three (FM1 and FM2) on the opposite side of the interaction point. FM2 and FMD are placed at about 70 cm from the nominal interaction point, while FM1 is placed much further from the interaction point, at about 320 cm on the side opposite to the muon arm.
\subsection*{The VZERO}
The V0 consists of two arrays of scintillator counters (VOA\footnote{A = ATLAS: it is on the side towards the ATLAS experiment} and VOC\footnote{C = CMS: it is on the side towards the CMS experiment}). The V0A is located 340 cm from the nominal interaction point, on the opposite side to the muon spectrometer, and covers the pseudorapidity range 2.8 < $\eta$ < 5.1. The V0C, instead, is fixed to the front of the hadronic absorber, at 90 cm from the interaction point, and covers the pseudorapidity range -3.7 < $\eta$ < -1.7. Both the detectors cover the full azimuthal angle interval. The V0 has many functions: it provides the \textit{Minimum-Bias} triggers and centrality triggers for Pb-Pb events, it can be used to measure the event multiplicity at forward rapidity, from which the centrality of the event can be determined, it is used for the rejection of background events.
\subsection*{The TZERO}
The detector consists of two arrays (T0A and T0C) of Cherenkov counters, placed at -72.5 cm and 375 cm from the interaction point. It covers the pseudorapidity ranges -3.28 < $\eta$ < -2.97 and 4.61 < $\eta$ < 4.92. Its main purpose is the generation of a start time (T0) fore the TOF detector, but it can also be used for an independent determination of the vertex position along the beam line, with a precision of 1.5 cm, and to provide the first level (L0) trigger when the position is within the expected value.
\subsection{Trigger System and Data acquisition}
The trigger system in ALICE is handled by the \textit{Central Trigger Processor}, which receives trigger inputs from the triggers detectors and sends trigger signals to the readout detectors in case the trigger conditions are fulfilled. It is based on three level of hardware triggers (L0, L1 and L2) and a fourth level (\textit{High Level Trigger}) of software triggers. This multi-level trigger is needed because of the large differences in the readout time of the detectors.\\
Trigger classes (minimum bias, high multiplicity, di-muons) are the combination of the trigger inputs of different triggers detector, obtained through logical operations with signals. The three trigger levels are characterized by a different response time. The L0 is a fast trigger, with a response time of 1.2 $\mu$s, and uses only detectors characterized by a high readiness, such as SPD, T0 and V0. If the L0 conditions are verified, the CTP sends the trigger signal to the readout detectors, which start registering the event. The L1 has a response of 6.5 $\mu$s and involves signal from all the detectors: in case after the response time no signal has been received by the CTP, readout detectors stop registering the event. The L2 trigger is the final preliminary check before the data transfer. It looks for specific problems which can spoil, or even make impossible, the reconstruction of the event, like for example the presence of two sequential lead-lead collisions, which would cause a too high occupancy in the TPC. If the L2 requirements are fulfilled, the event can be sent to the \textit{Data Acquisition System}, which manage the data flow from the detectors and to the archiving on tape. This process takes place in few steps. First, when the readout electronics of a detector is triggered, it send data to a farm of 300 individual computers (\textit{Local Data Concentrators} in the experimental site. Each LDC composes the fragment of data coming from detectors in sub-events. The sub-events are transferred to 40 \textit{Global Data Collectors}, systems of computers that perform the event building. Each GDC is able to process up to 40 events in parallel. At this moment, the data rate coming from the different sub-detectors is about 25 GB/s and the size of a central data can be $\sim$ 70 MB. For this reason the HLT performs an additional event selection and compression, optimizing the use of recording band available. This data compression allows to reach a data rate of about 1.25 GB/s. Finally, event seected by the HLT are transferred to the CERN computer centre to be recorded on tape.
\subsection{The ALICE Software}
The ALICE experiment software is based on ROOT, the data analysis framework developed at CERN. ROOT is an object oriented framework, developed in C++ and characterized by a high flexibility that allows to use ROOT in many different fields, even if its main applications are in particle physics. A dedicated group at CERN develops and maintains root but many contributions come from the whole particle physicist community, being ROOT an open source software. This framework provides I/O handling functionalities and many advanced statistical tools.\\
The framework adopted by the ALICE offline project is AliROOT, an object oriented code based on ROOT. The main purpose of AliROOT is to provide a set of software classes and macros to reconstruct and analyse data coming from the ALICE apparatus. For this reason it includes the geometry of the ALICE detectors, their typology and their response to the passage of particles. In addition AliRoot provides the tools for the local reconstruction and analysis of each detector.\\
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.30]{figures/reconstruction.png}
  \caption{Simulation and reconstruction process.}
  \label{fig:Rec}
\end{figure}
%
A scheme of the work flow of the simulation and reconstruction process in AliROOT can be found in Figure \ref{fig:Rec}: the left part shows the simulation steps, followed in the Monte Carlo simulations, while the right part shows the reconstruction steps, common for both real and simulated data.\\
The particles produced in the collision are created using generator codes for heavy-ions interactions such as HIJING and PYTHIA. The generated particles are  then transported through the detector with transport codes like GEANT and FLUKE, simulating the interaction with the material and the energy deposit in the active areas of the detectors, which constitutes the particle \textit{hits}, The information about the particle whoch has generated each hit is kept in the \textit{track label} associated to every hit. The next step is the simulation of the response to the hits of the detectors and the readout electronics. The digitization is done in two steps: \textit{summable digits}, produced with low thresholds and used fo the \textit{event merging}, in which signals coming from different events are summed together; \textit{digits}, generated with real trigger thresholds after the noise simulation and are comparable to real raw data.\\
During the reconstruction, digits are extracted from raw data and the adjacent digits are grouped together to form  a cluster, which is the signal given a particle in the detector. \textit{Rec-points} are defined by the reconstructed space position and, where possible, energy deposit. In the next step, the \textit{tracking}, the rec-points generated in the local reconstruction of each sub-detector are associated into \textit{tracks}, which contains the information about the kinematic parameters and the identity of the particles. Finally, the results from the reconstruction step are stored in \textit{Event Summary Data} (ESD, which can be further condensed into \textit{Analysis Object Data} (AOD), containing the essetnial information needed for the analysis.
